## Python Data Types
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```bash

Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool

```

### Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
```bash
int - Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
float - Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
complex - Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
```

```bash
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex
```
